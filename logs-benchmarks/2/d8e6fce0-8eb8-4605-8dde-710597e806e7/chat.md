Trying to achieve goal: Create a three_sum function in a file called sample_code.py. Given an array of integers, return indices of the three numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. Example: Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 20, Because nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 7 + 11 = 20, return [0, 1, 2].
