It defines one argument --len, which specifies the length of the password. If this argument is not provided, it defaults to 8. The script then calls password_generator.generate_password with the specified length, and prints the generated password. If an error occurs (for example, if an invalid length is provided), it catches the ValueError and prints an error message.\n\nYou can run this script from the command line like this:\n\n```bash\npython password_generator.py --len 12\n```\n\nThis will generate a 12-character password. If you don't provide the --len argument, it will generate an 8-character password:\n\n```bash\npython password_generator.py\n```\n\nYou can also import the password_generator module in another Python script and call the generate_password function directly:\n\n```python\nimport password_generator\n\npassword = password_generator.generate_password(len=10)\nprint(password)\n```\n\nThis will generate a 10-character password."
